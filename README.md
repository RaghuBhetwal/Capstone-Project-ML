# ML with Python: Predicting Points in F1 Formula Dataset

## Introduction
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the points scored in the F1 Formula dataset using various models. The F1 Formula dataset consists of several relevant features such as 'grid', 'position_x', 'laps', 'fastestLap', 'rank', and 'circuitId'. The target variable for prediction is the 'points_x' column. The goal of this project is to explore different models, including XGBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Decision Tree, and LSTM CNN, and evaluate their performance based on RMSE, R^2 score, and adjusted R^2.
